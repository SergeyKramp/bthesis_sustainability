ABSTRACT:
The aim of this thesis is to examine the amount of sustainability experience in 
supervisory boards of listed German companies. I do this by examining 78 supervisory boards 
of German listed companies on the DAX and MDAX stock market indexes. I use CV and 
annual report research to collect data. I find that the majority of supervisory boards do not 
have sustainability experience. In additional analyses, I find that there are several structural 
approaches supervisory board take to address sustainability, however, some can be considered 
“green washing” attempts. Moreover, I provide evidence that companies with strong brand 
awareness or companies in environmentally sensitive industries are more likely to have 
sustainability experience in their supervisory board. In addition, I find that supervisory board 
members with sustainability experience are more likely to be female than male, more likely to 
be international, and most commonly have a finance or innovation functional background.
